## Welcome to my Pygame paint program

This program was written in Pygame, and the icons were designed in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). 

### How to help:
1. When you are in full screen, the title bar [does not span entire screen](https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter/issues/1)
  - This results in a wierd effect happening to the [paint preview](https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter/issues/1)
