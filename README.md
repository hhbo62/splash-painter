# Welcome to Splash painter!

This program was written in Pygame, and the icons were designed in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html).

### How to help:
*1. When you are in full screen, the title bar [does not span entire screen](https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter/issues/1)
  - This results in a weird effect happening to the [paint preview](https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter/issues/1)  *
**NOTE:** This has [been fixed](https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter/pull/2)

# Updates:
## 1.5.6 is here!

### What's new?
- Bug Fixes
- Title Bar
- New colors
- Buttons for clear, eraser, and brush size bigger and smaller!
- Performance improvements under the hood

# Download:
1. Make a new folder called splash-painter
2. [Download](https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter) all files AS-IS into the splash-painter directory
3. Make sure you have pygame installed (pip install pygame)
4. Open main.py in a python IDE and run.
