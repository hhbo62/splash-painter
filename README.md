# Welcome to Splash painter!

This program was written in Pygame, and the icons were designed in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html).

### How to help:
1. When you are in full screen, the title bar [does not span entire screen](https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter/issues/1)
  - This results in a weird effect happening to the [paint preview](https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter/issues/1)  
**NOTE** This has [been fixed] (https://github.com/hhbo62/splash-painter/pull/2)

# Updates:
## 1.5.6 is here!
With a completely re-design interface, this is probably the biggest update ever!

### What's new?
- Bug Fixes
- Title Bar
- New colors
- Buttons for clear, eraser, and brush size bigger and smaller!
- Performance improvements under the hood
